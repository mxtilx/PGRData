Through computational analysis derived from witness statements and database information, there is a high possibility that, Commandant, you, will be deemed as the person in charge.\\nAs such, in the following few days, Babylonia Regional Administrations has a 66.3% chance to request from you a statement of responsibility, explanation of circumstances, and other such relevant information. I have already prepared all the possible documents you might require, and you need only sign your name on them. I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call \"Lunar New Year\".\\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together. Your command decisions have brought us victory and hope.\\nYour efforts were not unrecognized by us.\\nWell...

You make a mistake, you get disciplined. That's how it should go in the army.\\nBabylonia's holidays should be over soon.

I was looking at it, and I thought, \"How hard could it be?\"\\nWell... the fried rice I made was a little burnt, I'll admit. I was going to throw it away and just get you a takeaway, but I took the wrong box... And why would you think that burnt rice is safe to eat?\\nAhem. I bet you still haven't eaten anything with everything that happened. This nightmare-spicy golden egg fried rice and cheese hotteok is from the restaurant in the commercial district. I was going to have them for dinner, so they're safe to eat.\\nIs it just me, or does this Activation Date feel like a mess? Still... I guess it's only fitting that the day would be as chaotic as it was.\\n...I suppose I have to \"make up\" for all that trouble, don't I?\\nThere's a new restaurant I've been hoping to try. I thought we could give it a go together, so I've booked us a table every day next week. I'll be waiting for you there at dinnertime.\\nSee you tomorrow.",

Humans forget their births, but Constructs don't. What happened on the day they became a Construct is forever remembered.\\nOn that day, I was greeted by fear, hatred, and betrayal. Then, bullets and blades. I returned the favor afterward.\\nThe hate in me has faded over time. All there remains is the cold hard truth they imprinted on me and this world. I know that the path we took meant that we all have blood on our hands. The opportunity to turn back has long passed us... not that we need it anymore.\\nUnlike those humans, I won't make excuses for what I've done. To me, those people are all merely specks of dust among the despicable humans.\\nBut you... you're different...",

Apart from my wish and my voice, I hear another voice that acknowledges the paradise where I can live with my sister... while also acknowledging the future of humankind.\\nThere should be someone like you on the path to the future\u2014someone who is foolish enough to connect with an Ascendant.\\nHa. You wouldn't give in even if it cost your life.
