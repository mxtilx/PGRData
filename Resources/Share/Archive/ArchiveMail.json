Through computational analysis derived from witness statements and database information, there is a high possibility that, Commandant, you, will be deemed as the person in charge.\\nAs such, in the following few days, Babylonia Regional Administrations has a 66.3% chance to request from you a statement of responsibility, explanation of circumstances, and other such relevant information. I have already prepared all the possible documents you might require, and you need only sign your name on them. I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call \"Lunar New Year\".\\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together. Your command decisions have brought us victory and hope.\\nYour efforts were not unrecognized by us.\\nWell...

You make a mistake, you get disciplined. That's how it should go in the army.\\nBabylonia's holidays should be over soon.
