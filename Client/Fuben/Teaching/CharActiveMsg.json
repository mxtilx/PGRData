One of them was badly injured.\\nI asked Lucia if we could help them, but she shook her head and said, \"We are powerless to help them. The remaining resources are set aside to make sure our safety.\"\\nWhen she saw my worried face, she patted my head and promised that she would protect me and that we would never end up like the birds.\\nI nodded, but a feeling of helplessness washed over me.\\nI wish I could protect others like Lucia.\\nWhen this foolish idea and my childlike disposition got the better of me, I gave away the winter supplies she had left.\\nI anticipated at least a thank-you in return, yet I received nothing.\\nI am worthless in comparison to my capable sister. I began to despair at the selfishness and greed of others.\\nI have to make up for it. At least, I must protect my beloved sister.\\n\\nI went to check on the white doves earlier today. When I got close, I realized they weren't real birds.\\nThe exposed frame became entangled in the red currents. Despite this, the other remained close. Both will be corrupted if they continue in this manner.\\\"...Will I be a burden like this to Lucia if I accept to be modified?\" \\nTroubled by this thought, I stayed in the corridor, undecided, until I came across the Sister who is always praying.\\nAfter talking with her, I decided to take the trial. To keep Lucia safe, I have to pass it.\\nGoodbye. We'll see each other again.\\nFor the time being, I'll bid you a quiet farewell with a hand that shares your bloodline.\\n",

        "Content": "21:23 p.m. Old Church.\\nLucia also left the abbey today, following her sister Luna's departure.n\\Even though I'd only spoken with them few times, I knew they were blessed by God the moment the abbess took them in.\\nThe elder sister had a stern expression on her face, a lucky one who could survive and thrive in catastrophes.\\nThe younger one had a pair of naive eyes, blessed and protected from disasters.\\nHowever, other sisters disagreed, asserting that they would perish in the winter and deriding Luna's giving away supplies as a joke.\\nDoes kindness deserve to be mocked, Lord?\\nI prayed all night for the innocent sisters, and God had finally given the favored children a chance.\\nEveryone in the church was terrified when those \"big shots\" showed up, except the sisters. They jumped at the chance and even passed the copolymer filtering, as if eagerly awaiting the guide of prophecy.\\nI was curious to find out whether Lucia had made through the modification. I even requested a soldier to bring me the news. After all, it's comforting to know that kind-hearted children will live on. It was like the gospel of God, bringing one a ray of hope in this dark world.\\nSurprisingly, I saw Luna in the corridor on my way to morning prayer. When I asked what was bothering her, she said she was wondering if she would be able to replace her sister.\\nThis was going to be a test for the two of them, I told her. Only the successful would be noticed by the god, who would help them overcome their obstacles.\\nSeeing how reluctant she was, I mocked her in the tone used by the other nuns. She eventually walked away, mumbling something about the trial. I was relieved to see her leave, but I also felt ominous.\\n\\nToday, Lucia also left the church. I had yet to hear from the soldier who had promised to bring me the updates. He took a can from me, after all.\\nThat can had the most time left on its expiration date.\\n",

Although they are all compatible with the copolymers, I think few could actually make it.\\nExcept one girl named Lucia. I liked her from the moment I saw her profile. She is only a child, yet she is a skilled weapon wielder. If she accepts and completes the modification, she will be a formidable combat force.\\nHowever, it was her sister who insisted on coming in her place. When the soldiers saw that she met the requirements, they simply took her back! Where is her sister Lucia?\\nThat ignorant girl kept asking me what she would become of and even gave me an angry look after hearing my explanation.\\nShe was whining about wanting to grow up. However, only her sister's strong consciousness could handle a unit beyond her age.\\nIn any case, we'll see how it goes after the modifications. Best of luck, kiddo. Now, only a stroke of luck can save you.\\n",
